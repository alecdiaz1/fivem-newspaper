# fivem-newspaper
Simple resource that allows anyone to create, read, and delete newspapers, which contain one or more articles

## Usage
You should be able to just drop this folder into wherever your resources are, then using the in-game chat:

`/newspaper`

If for some reason you need to rebuild the resource, go to the `web` folder and run `(yarn | npm) run build:resources`

### Notes
I would normally put the firebase credentials in an ENV file but since this is just for testing purposes and this repo is private, I left it in.
